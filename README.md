Hello Alter family,


We will be discontinuing code access and archiving our Github repositories on November 29, 2022. After that date, developers will be able to use previously downloaded copies of mocap4face as long as they continue to comply with the terms of service. Please note that after November 29, 2022, all of our SDKs will no longer be updated or supported and all package hosting (NPM and Gradle) will be shut down.


We are grateful for your understanding.


Alter
